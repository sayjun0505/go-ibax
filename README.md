### Build from Source

#### Install Go

The build process for go-ibax requires Go 1.17 or higher. If you don't have it: [Download Go 1.17+](https://go.dev).

You'll need to add Go's bin directories to your `$PATH` environment variable e.g., by adding these lines to
your `/etc/profile` (for a system-wide installation) or `$HOME/.profile`:

```
$ export GOPROXY=https://athens.azurefd.net
$ GO111MODULE=on go mod tidy -v

$ go build
```

### Run

1. Create the node configuration file:

```bash
$    go-ibax config
```

2. Generate node keys:
